# Cursor Rule: Mobile Responsiveness

## Goal
Ensure all UI components, especially Properties Panel and Agent Chat UI, are fully responsive and usable on mobile devices.

## Requirements
- Use Tailwind CSS responsive utilities (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) for layout and spacing.
- Test all panels and chat UI on small screens (â‰¤ 640px width).
- Ensure touch targets are large enough and spacing is adequate.
- Avoid horizontal scrolling; use vertical stacking for narrow screens.
- Hide or collapse non-essential UI on mobile (sidebars, extra panels).
- Use mobile-friendly input components (larger buttons, inputs, etc.).
- Test with device emulation and real devices if possible.

## Implementation Hints
- Use CSS grid/flex layouts with responsive breakpoints.
- Add tests for mobile layouts and edge cases.
