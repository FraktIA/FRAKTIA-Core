# Cursor Rule: Implement Agent Chat UI

## Goal
Create a chat interface for agent interaction, supporting message history, user input, and agent responses.

## Requirements
- UI should resemble a modern chat/messaging app (bubble layout, timestamps, avatars optional).
- Support sending and displaying messages from both user and agent.
- Scroll to latest message on new message.
- Input box should support multiline and send on Enter (with Shift+Enter for newline).
- Show loading indicator while agent is responding.
- Use React state for chat history and input.
- Style with Tailwind CSS for consistency and mobile support.
- Ensure accessibility (aria-labels, keyboard navigation, etc.).

## Implementation Hints
- Use a dedicated component for the chat panel.
- Consider extracting message bubble as a subcomponent.
- Add tests for message rendering and input edge cases.
