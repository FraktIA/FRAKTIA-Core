# Cursor Rule: Global Form Input & Configuration State

## Goal
Implement a global state to store all form input and configuration data for nodes/agents, accessible throughout the app.

## Requirements
- Use Redux (or context if preferred) to store all configuration and form input values.
- Update global state on every form input change in the Properties Panel and other config UIs.
- Ensure state is serializable and can be saved/restored (for export/import or undo/redo).
- Provide selectors and actions for updating, resetting, and retrieving configuration.
- Document the structure of the global config state.
- Ensure type safety (TypeScript interfaces/types).

## Implementation Hints
- Add a new slice to Redux for configuration if not present.
- Use controlled components for all form fields.
- Add tests for state updates and edge cases.
