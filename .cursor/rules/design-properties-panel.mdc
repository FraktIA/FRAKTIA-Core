# Cursor Rule: Design Properties Panel

## Goal
Design the Properties Panel UI to be clear, user-friendly, and visually consistent with the rest of the application - the main colors are (white,bg,dark,and primary. Using tailwind classes e.g.text-bg). Ensure it supports all node types and is easily extendable for future configuration options.

## Requirements
- Use a card or panel layout with clear sectioning for each property.
- Display all editable properties for the selected node, with appropriate input types (text, select, toggle, etc.).
- If no configuration is required, the display an aesthetic message saying configured.
- Ensure accessibility (labels, focus states, etc.).
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and maintain design consistency.
- Support both desktop and mobile layouts.
- Hook inputs to thier global variable counterparts using redux.
- Use React best practices (controlled components, state management, etc.).

## Implementation Hints
- Use a form structure for property editing.
- Consider extracting property field components for reuse.
- Add tests for edge cases (empty, invalid, or large property sets).
